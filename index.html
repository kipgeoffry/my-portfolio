            <h3>My New Journey in Programming</h3>
            <p id="cont.p1">
                I have had extensive experience in enterprise services which i have designed,implemented and supported
                throughout my working experience journey
                <br>
                This included deployment of various solution and technologies which included:
                <ul>
                    <li>Connectivity solutions: MPLS WAN,SDWAN,Layer 2 Point-to-point</li>
                    <li>Managed security services:Fortinet suite,Sophos suite and opensource tools like untangle</li>
                    <li>Cloud Solutions on different public clouds:AWS,microsoft azure and safaricom cloud</li>
                </ul>
                In my working experience,alot has changed and the <span>old manual & repetitive tasks need automation</span>,i
                wanted to
                be part of this automation journey,
                <br>
                so the first skill to have is programming and this motivated me to take a class in programming.
                <br>
                After having all the skills above,and safaricom's motivation of <em>#1moreskill</em>,programming was definately
                my next go to skill
                <br>
                and voila i got an opportunity to joint Moringa coding school to acquire this skill.
