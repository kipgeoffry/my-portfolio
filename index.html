        <p>
            I have had extensive experience in enterprise services which i have designed implemented and supported throughout my working experience journey
            <br>
            This included deployment of various solution and technologies which included:
            <ul>
                <li>Connectivity solutions: MPLS WAN,SDWAN,Layer 2 Point-to-point</li>

                <li>Cloud Solutions on different public clouds:AWS,microsoft azure and safaricom cloud</li>     
            </ul>
            In my working experience,alot has changed and the old manual & repetitive tasks need automation,a bit of it has been achieved and i wanted to be part of this automation,so the first skill to have was programming and this is the skill area that i wanted to have in my skillset.
            Having all these skills,and safaricom's motivation of #1moreskill,programming was definately my next go to skill and voila i got an opportunity to joint Moringa coding school to acquire this skill.
